# mongo-lazy

Node-mongodb-native for lazy people. Don't ever open a collection again. Eat a piece of cake while doing parallel queries.    
All the methods of node-mongodb-native are available. See [the official documentation][0].

## Installation

    npm install mongo-lazy

## Usage
    
    node --harmony yourScript.js

The --harmony flag is necessary because we're using Harmony proxies to open and cache collections transparently.

## Example

``` js
  // Open a db w/ the 3 args of mongodb.Db(dbName, servConfig, options) or w/ 1 obj-arg like above
  var db = require('mongo-lazy').open({
    db: 'yummy',
    host: 'ds037987.mongolab.com',
    port: 37987,
    user: 'guest',
    password: '123456'
  });

  // No need to open collections anymore, just call them as you would usually do with the mongo CLI
  db.drink.findOne({name: 'Dom Perignon'}, function(err, domPerignon) {
    console.log('A good wine:\n', err || domPerignon, '\n');
  });

  // The 'findAll' method returns all the elements of a collection (equiv to find + toArray) 
  db.meal.findAll({from: 'France'}, function(err, frenchMeals) {
    console.log('French meals:\n', err || frenchMeals, '\n');
  });

  // Easy parallel queries: callback returns when all queries return or earlier if an error happened
  db([
    ['drink', 'findOne', {price: 'free'}],
    ['meal', 'findOne', {price: 'cheap'}],
    ['dessert', 'findAll', {quality: "good"}, {fields: {name: 1, _id: 0}}]
  ], function(err, drink, meal, desserts) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Drink:\n', drink);
    console.log('Meal:\n', meal);
    console.log('Desserts:\n', desserts, '\nBon appetit!\n');  
  });
```
